##System requirements
###Functional requirements
- storing users schedule
- forming task completion statistics
- providing schedule editing tools
- displaying pet state according to users sucess rate

###Quality requirements(Non-functional)
Reliability certainly is the ground aspect for ToDoGothi. No matter what happened, schedules must stay consistent and be available in any time at the user's request. 
Acessability comes next to reliability. The UI must provide easy-to-master navigation without being messy and overcomplicated
