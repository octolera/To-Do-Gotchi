# UX Criteria

- Recognizability
- Learning ability
- Usability
- Input validation
- Style
- Accessibility

## 1 Recognizability

Application wireframe contains recognizable elements. Almost all buttons are named.
On example lower you can see missused icon buttons. They need to be replaced. #[missuse](https://github.com/octolera/ToDoGotchi/blob/main/WorkReview/assets/ux1.png)

## 2 Learning ability

This application does not contain any help or manual because it does not need one. Even a child can easily figure out how to use it.

## 3 Usability

On small screens some elements can be unreachable. Needs to be properly tested and fixed.

## 4 Input validation

Input is processed as string and restrincted by length.

## 5 Style

Application UI have consintent style and color palette. See [SRS](https://github.com/octolera/ToDoGotchi/blob/main/Requirements/SRS.md) for additional info.

## 6 Accessibility

ToDoGotchi is strongly focussed on visual representtion. So there is no actual benefit of using it with visual disability against some simpler task trackers. Screen reader support is now limited.
